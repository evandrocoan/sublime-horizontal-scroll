Ever wanted to scroll horizontally in Sublime Text with your keyboard?
Well. Now you can.


## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
   Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
       ],
   ```
1. And,
   change it to the following, i.e.,
   put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
   ```
   * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
     you will not install this forked version of the package,
     but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,
   go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
search for **`HorizontalScroll`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

## Usage

#### The Short

Is there text running off the edge of your editor?
Is this plug-in installed?
Press `alt+down`. Or `ctrl+alt+shift+down` if you're on a Mac.

There weren't any good hotkeys left! I'm sorry!


#### The Long

This plug-in adds one command to Sublime Text which exposes easy-to-hotkey horizontal scrolling, and makes a guess as to how to incorporate it for you.

By default, the hotkeys to scroll right and left are, respectively, `alt+down` and `alt+up` for Windows/Linux, or `ctrl+alt+shift+down` and `ctrl+alt+shift+up` if you're on a Mac -- chosen to reflect Sublime's default `scroll_lines` behavior (`ctrl+up/down` and `ctrl+alt+up/down`). This, of course, can be mapped to any hotkey combination you might by want by modifying your personal `Preferences -> Key Bindings - User`. (And seriously, if you're on a Mac, please do.)

The command that this plug-in adds is (at most):

    "command": "scroll_width", "args": {"amount": [+/-]30, "by_character": True}

If `by_character` is left `True` motion is based on the width of an em-dash, which allows this command to scale motion with your current font size. If `by_character` is `False`, `scroll_width` will move the screen by `amount` of raw pixels. I'd recommend pumping `amount` up to at least 150 if you're not scrolling `by_character`.
`by_character` defaults to `True`, by the way, so if you ever set this command up -- when, say, rebinding the Mac keys -- you can skip that argument.
`amount` is simply a relative indicator of how far every call to `scroll_width` will move the screen, with negative scrolling the screen left.
